        <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>

        <p class="aboutText">I believe myself to be a detail-oriented and creative thinker with a passion for learning and building. Whether I’m collaborating on a team or working independently, I bring focus, flexibility, and a love for solving problems to every challenge I take on.</p>

        <p class="aboutText">My background includes leadership roles where I honed my skills in communication, organization, and conflict resolution — all of which I now apply to my work as a developer. I thrive in environments where curiosity and continuous growth are valued.</p>
            
            <p class="aboutText">Outside of coding, you’ll find me exploring the outdoors, camping under the stars, hiking new trails, or experimenting with recipes in the kitchen. Just like in programming, I enjoy the process of combining small elements — spices, steps, or lines of code — into something meaningful and complete.</p>
            
            <p class="aboutText">I believe that creativity lives in the details, and I’m excited to keep building, learning, and pushing myself forward in this journey.</p>
