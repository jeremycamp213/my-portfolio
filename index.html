            Hi! I'm Jeremy, a passionate and curious web developer in training. This website is a snapshot of my journey as I learn and grow in the world of coding. Here, you'll find more about me, some of the projects I've worked on, and ways to get in touch.
         </p>

            <P class ="myIntro">Whether you're a fellow student, instructor, or someone just exploring thanks for stopping by! Use the navigation above to learn more about my background, view my projects, or reach out.
            </P>

            <p class="myIntro">I believe that creativity and problem-solving go hand in hand, and coding gives me the perfect space to explore both. Every project I build teaches me something newâ€”whether it's about design, logic, or how to better collaborate with others. I'm excited about where this path will lead and look forward to growing my skills one line of code at a time.</p>
